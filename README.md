# Customer Churn Project
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the banking industry, where acquiring new customers costs significantly more than retaining existing ones. This project implements two powerful machine learning approaches to predict customer churn:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A robust classification algorithm that finds optimal decision boundaries
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Dense Model: A deep learning approach that captures complex non-linear patterns.

The project uses bank customer data including:

Customer Demographics: Age, gender, geography
Account Information: Credit score, tenure, balance
Product Usage: Number of products, credit card ownership, active membership
Financial Behavior: Estimated salary, transaction patterns
Target Variable: Churn status (0: Retained, 1: Churned)
